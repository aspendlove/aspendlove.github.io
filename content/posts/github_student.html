    <p>Just a quick post this week. I wanted to call out the GitHub Student Developer Pack program, it is free for all U
        of U
        students and I don&#39;t think many people take advantage of this. GitHub Developer Pack gives you access to
        exclusive events, classes, and my favorite, discounts on software, ranging from highly discounted to straight up
        free. My main motivation for signing up is that you can get the entire JetBrains professional suite for free,
        including Intellij and Pycharm professional. To sign up just go to this <a
            href="https://education.github.com/pack/offers" target="_blank">link</a> or the homepage <a href="https://education.github.com/students" target="_blank">here</a>, sign in or sign up for a GitHub
            account, and submit a document with official u of u letterhead, and you&#39;re in.</p>
