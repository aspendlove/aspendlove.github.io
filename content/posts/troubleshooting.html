    <p>In this past week, just out of the blue, I have had numerous problems with my laptop, ranging from annoying to
        concerning. My server also completely went down on Sunday, and four days later is only 90% repaired. While I
        have had to deal with some complex issues involving extensive use of the command line, there are many other
        problems that are much simpler to solve. In this post, I&#39;ll offer general troubleshooting steps for anyone,
        coming from a professional IT technician.</p>
    <h2 id='basic-troubleshooting-steps'>Basic Troubleshooting Steps</h2>
    <p>Here are some troubleshooting steps that anyone can do. I generally want to solve your problems without needing
        to bring it in for examination and repair, but if you do, the lovely people at <a
            href='https://integralitservices.com/' target="_blank">Integral IT Services</a> would love to help, although
        I am a little
        biased because I work there over the summers ðŸ˜›. We work with business clients, as well as residential.</p>

            <p>If you are experiencing crashes and weird behavior, it may be your hard drive</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Install crystal disk info <a
                        href='https://crystalmark.info/redirect.php?product=CrystalDiskInfoInstaller'
                        target="_blank">here</a>, or go to its homepage <a href='https://crystalmark.info/en/download/'
                        target="_blank">here</a>. Ignore the anime themed versions, computer programmers can sometimes
                    have <em>interesting</em> tastes. It is also open source, meaning that the code can be audited by
                    anyone <a href='https://github.com/hiyohiyo/crystaldiskinfo/' target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
                <li>After installing Crystal Disk Info, open the application and look for a giant green box on the
                    left-hand side that says &quot;Disk is OK&quot;, or something to that effect. If it says anything
                    other than OK, or is red/yellow instead of green, then you will need a new hard drive. The good news
                    for you, is that hard drives are relatively inexpensive, easy to install, and often times your data
                    will be able to be recovered, although there are no guarantees. I would always recommend to at least
                    have one backup for your files, which may include uploading them to the cloud. Ideally you would
                    have more backups, but realistically, the average person doesn&#39;t have the time or resources to
                    do more. If you need a hard drive replacement, you will have to take it in to be repaired.</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you are having issues with strange flickering or visual artifacts, for example strange lines or
                colored boxes all over the screen, you either have an issue with your monitor, or your graphics card.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>First, because this is the easiest, try getting a different cable to connect your device with an
                    external monitor. You&#39;ll be surprised how often this is the problem.</li>
                <li>If the monitor in question is an external monitor, try plugging another device into it. If the
                    second device exhibits the same visual glitches, you will need a new monitor. If the glitches go
                    away, then you will need a new graphics card. If you need a new graphics card, you will most likely
                    have to take it in. </li>
                <li>If you don&#39;t have an external monitor, and instead you have a laptop display exhibiting the
                    issues, there is no simple way to see where the issue originates, and you will need to bring it in
                    to be repaired.</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If your computer starts feeling a bit sluggish, <strong>Do not install a cleaner app</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>At best, cleaner apps are placebo, at worst, malware.</li>
                <li>Instead, you may want to reinstall windows, or install a faster hard drive, which can be done easily
                    at any IT place.</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If your computer is still slow, you may just need a new one.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are certain things that can be upgraded to make your computer faster, but generally, if you
                    simply want a PC that works without you having to think about it, I recommend just buying a newer
                    model.</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you have a keyboard key that doesn&#39;t work</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You probably ate some chips over your keyboard, or something to that effect. It will have to be
                    cleaned or replaced, which will need to be done at a repair shop.</li>
                <li>If you want to avoid this, you can get a silicone keyboard cover.</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you spilled water on your laptop</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your laptop most likely will be gone, but your hard drive may still be salvageable. Take it in for
                    repairs, and you&#39;ll most likely walk away will all your precious photos.</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Problems after Windows update...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pray to the Windows gods to take mercy on your soul.</li>
                <li>You could also wait until it&#39;s fixed in another update, but the first solution sounds better.
                </li>

            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are many more situations, but these are the ones I could think of off the top of my head. If you do want to
        perform any of these repairs yourself, like installing a new hard drive, which isn't too difficult, I would encourage you to 
        try. A word of warning, however. If you do, you will officially become the IT tech to your family and friends and will perpetually
        be fixing their problems ðŸ˜….
