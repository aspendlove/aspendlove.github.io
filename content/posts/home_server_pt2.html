    <body><p>This is part two of my home server post. Read part 1 before this
            post.</p>
        <h1 id='moving-to-pc'>Moving to PC</h1>
        <p>I left off last post talking about the new mini PC that I bought. It
            was turning out to be a considerable update over the raspberry pi,
            but all the software I was used to running on my raspberry pi was
            either incompatible, or simple enough that I wanted to go beyond.
            The biggest thing I wanted to change was to move away from
            nextcloudPi as an operating system, and move to a general purpose
            server operating system.</p>
        <h2 id='choosing-an-operating-system'>Choosing an Operating System</h2>
        <p>For as long as I&#39;ve used a computer, I&#39;ve used some flavor of
            Linux, therefore I am very familiar with the base that powers a
            large majority of servers in production today. In my work most of
            our clients used Windows Server, but for my use case it offers no
            benefits over Linux, and actually would be much worse. Running
            Windows Server would be expensive, slow, difficult to use, and
            inflexible. The only reason that companies use Windows Server for
            their internal business use is because it integrates well with their
            windows workstations with Active Directory.</p>
        <p>So I decided to use Linux, but that doesn&#39;t narrow it down much.
            There are many different flavors of Linux out there, and a lot of it
            comes down to personal preference. Luckily I have had a long time to
            try almost all of them, so I knew what I wanted almost immediately.
            Here&#39;s how I narrowed it down. For reference a distro, or
            distribution, refers to a specific implementation of an operating
            system based on the Linux kernel and surrounding tools.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Debian</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Pros</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Debian is what powers nextcloudPi, and makes a
                                good server operating system because feature
                                updates are very slow to roll out, meaning big
                                changes that may mess up your applications does
                                not happen as often. Security updates are still
                                pushed out regularly</li>
                            <li>Debian is very basic compared to other Linux
                                flavors, and is very simple to use and flexible
                                because of that.</li>
                            <li>Debian has a large support base and has been
                                around for a long time</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Cons</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Debian uses the apt package manager. This is
                                mostly personal preference, but I find it to be
                                less stable and overall buggier</li>
                            <li>Debian does not offer advanced niceties that
                                some of the other distros</li>
                            <li>Very hard to install</li>

                        </ul>

            <li><p>Ubuntu</p>

                    <li><p>Pros</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ubuntu has a very large support base, and is
                                based on Debian, so it can also make use of
                                Debian&#39;s support base</li>
                            <li>Ubuntu has some advanced features, such as
                                support for the snap packaging format by
                                default.</li>
                            <li>Ubuntu offers long term support releases that
                                are supported for 5 years</li>
                            <li>Easy to install</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Cons</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I have found Ubuntu to be less than stable</li>
                            <li>The apt package manager is also used</li>
                            <li>Ubuntu still lacks many advanced features</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                            <li><p>RHEL offers long term releases for 10 years
                                    as opposed to Ubuntu&#39;s 5</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p>RHEL offers many advanced features, such as</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Cockpit, which provides a web interface
                                        to remotely manage your server</li>
                                    <li>Toolbox, which creates containers to
                                        isolate certain operations on your
                                        system</li>
                                    <li>Immutable Filesystems, which on the
                                        editions that it is included in
                                        disallows the system from being modified
                                        and only allowing changes to be made
                                        through containerization.</li>
                                    <li>Firewalld, a new advanced firewall and
                                        network routing backend</li>

                            <li><p>RHEL uses the DNF package manager which I
                                    have found to be much more stable and
                                    reliable over APT</p>

                            <li><p>RHEL is backed by the resources at Red Hat
                                    and IBM</p>
                            </li>

                    </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>DNF is slightly slower than APT in most
                                operations</li>
                            <li>RHEL is harder to install than Ubuntu, but
                                easier than Debian</li>
                            <li>Depending on the version you may have to pay for
                                RHEL</li>

                        </ul>

                </ul>
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>I ended up going with Fedora, which is a faster updating free version
            of RHEL. I use Fedora Workstation on my desktop and laptop, so it
            makes sense to use Fedora Server as well.</p>
        <h2 id='next-up'>Next up</h2>
        <p>Didn&#39;t realize this would need a part 3, next I&#39;ll talk about
            setting fedora server up with services.</p>
