    <h1>The VPN Scare</h1>
    <p>Although it's died down a little bit in the last couple of months, we've seen an incredible push for VPN services
        in
        the past year or two. Big companies are claiming that your data is constantly under attack and that they are the
        only
        ones who can secure it. Let's look at what actually happens.</p>
    <h2>A VPN analogy</h2>
    <p>Imagine the internet is more like the mail service. When you want to connect to a website, you send a package to
        their address. This package, of course, is sent by the postal service in a regular box. This works well enough,
        but
        soon malicious actors started to ruin things for everyone. Imagine that you are packaging up some private
        financial
        information to send to your bank, and then imagine that someone is sitting near you watching. When you hand the
        package to a mail carrier to be sent, the person sitting next to you sneaks up and takes the package from the
        mail
        carrier. They then dig through it, take a look around, snap a couple pictures of your personal information, and
        then
        repackage it and give it back to the mail carrier. This is obviously not great, and soon people got fed up with
        such
        low security with this mail system. So a new standard was created for sending packages, named HTTPS. HTTPS
        encrypts
        data in transit, which is like putting your private bank details in a metal lock box instead of a cardboard box.
        Now,
        when the hacker tries to look inside the box, they won't be able to pick the lock and take a look around. When
        your
        bank gets the package, they are able to open it and process your information without anyone intercepting your
        private
        information.</p>
    <p>But putting a lock on your packages isn't a silver bullet. While HTTPS prevents anyone from unlocking the metal
        package, they can look at the label on top. They can see your name, and where you are sending your data to. This
        information can actually be quite important to others. For example, if Google takes a look at that package, and
        they
        see that you are sending letters to a shoe company, they may try to target you with shoe ads. An even bigger
        threat,
        however, is the idea that the government can see what websites you are accessing, and discriminate against you
        based
        on that information. If you are a protester against the government, and frequently visit certain sites
        adversarial
        to
        their political agenda, they may be able to track you down and punish you. Depending on the government, this
        punishment could be quite severe.</p>
    <p>What a VPN does is quite interesting. It essentially acts as a private postal service. This postal service
        applauds
        itself for security and privacy, and guarantees you safe passage for your packages. They still use the same
        roads
        and
        infrastructure that is the internet, but they act almost as private escorts for your package, fending off anyone
        who
        wants to take a peek. This can bring great benefits to the sender, and not just because of the personalized
        protection
        for your package. Because this private postal service gets to operate outside the normal networks, they can
        modify
        your package labels. This allows you to, say, change the return address of the package to make it look like you
        are
        in
        an entirely different country. Many people use this feature to bypass Geo-restricted features in, say, Netflix
        to be
        able to watch foreign shows.</p>
    <p>But VPNs aren't all sunshine and rainbows, remember that you're still entrusting your data to a postal carrier,
        even
        if they promise that they take privacy and security seriously. They will have exclusive access to all the data
        on
        your
        package label, and be able to sell that information in large amounts to other companies, nullifying the privacy
        benefits that VPN's claim to solve. It can be very hard to verify VPN company practices, with many companies
        introducing complex privacy policies and purposefully obfuscate the details of their operations. VPNs have
        become so
        popular, that even Google is making a VPN, which is equivalent to handing your data to an ad agency. As a side
        note,
        there's a good word of warning around free VPN's: If the product is free, you are the product. Hiring this many
        postal
        workers costs a lot of money. Speaking of that, because this private postal service is a smaller company, your
        packages often take longer to arrive, slowing down your overall bandwidth. There will be delays in how long
        packages
        take to reach you, causing major issues when trying to play games with other people, where your game information
        needs
        to be updated quickly to keep the game synced between multiple people. VPN's also aren't even allowed in many
        places.
        Famously, China has blocked all unsanctioned VPN software that would allow internet traffic through the great
        firewall
        (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/05/china-censorship-vpn-ban-party-congress/">source</a>).</p>
    <p>The interesting thing is that VPN's actually make much more sense in a business setting. Businesses often require
        private postal companies to handle their internal affairs, because they often use internal mechanisms and
        packages
        that may only be intended for private use, and not guaranteed to be safe through the general postal service.
        These business however, create their own private postal service that they control themselves, mitigating most of
        the
        problems with commercial VPN services</p>
    <h2>To conclude...</h2>
    <p>To sum this long post up, VPN's can be useful in certain settings. They can protect your packages from anyone
        trying
        to take a cursory glance, but protections are already in place to keep them from opening the packages
        themselves.
        Hiring a private postal service can be beneficial, but you also put a lot of trust in the private entity, and
        you'll
        have to pay dearly for the privilege with your wallet. Most people are better off just sticking with plain old
        HTTPS, and if you
        really
        need privacy, say because you're a government whistle-blower, there's always <a
            href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a>.</p>
