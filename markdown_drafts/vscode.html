    <p>I have been trying out multiple different editors for web development, programs like Dreamweaver, Atom, Brackets,
        etc. The best I&#39;ve found so far is Microsoft&#39;s Visual Studio Code (VSCode). It&#39;s a general purpose
        text editor that is a jack of all trades. It has a minimal base that you can extend quite a lot with extensions.
        You can add support for new programming languages, hardware, themes, and many other things. Specifically for
        HTML and CSS though, it comes well adjusted for web development by default. In this post I want to share a
        couple things that will help you develop websites in VSCode, as well as why it&#39;s such a useful tool.</p>
    <h2 id='whats-wrong-with-dreamweaver'>What&#39;s wrong with Dreamweaver?</h2>
    <p>Dreamweaver is a great tool if you are familiar with other adobe products such as Photoshop or Illustrator. It
        presents editing websites in a more graphical manner, allowing you to focus on design more than code. My problem
        with that approach is that often Dreamweaver doesn&#39;t do what I want it to, and I have to dive into the code
        anyways. Because of this inefficient switch between graphical design and code, I find it much easier to work
        directly with the code. When editing the code I can make sure it does exactly what I intend. I can make sure
        that classes are applied properly, items are nested, the code is readable, and no superfluous paragraph tags get
        added by accident.</p>
    <h2 id='why-not-just-use-dreamweaver-in-code-mode'>Why not just use Dreamweaver in code mode?</h2>
    <p>This is more a matter of personal preference. Dreamweaver is very much an Adobe tool. It retains the same model
        of panels and menus packed to the brim with options. Many of these are helpful, such as the CSS Designer or the
        DOM, but the sheer number of options displayed on screen at the same time is distracting to me. Also, because of
        all these features, the application feel sluggish on my 2017 era laptop. I could try and reign Dreamweaver in
        and remove parts of the interface reflect my workflow more, but that takes considerable effort and would not
        solve the performance issues.</p>
    <h2 id='enter-vscode'>Enter VSCode</h2>
    <p>VSCode is a text editor tailored specifically for programmers. It&#39;s widely used in the industry and garners a
        huge support base. VSCode by default is very minimal, but it contains crucial features that many other simple
        text editors are lacking in. <a href='https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense'>Intellisense</a>
        is one such feature. It allows code completion while you type, which is essential to any programmers tool belt.
        It saves large amounts of typing which aside from speeding up the development process, can prevent typos by
        limiting the superfluous code that a programmer would otherwise have to type. Dreamweaver includes a form of
        intellisense, but it is not quite as robust as the implementation that VSCode uses. Other features implemented
        in VSCode include advanced refactoring, search and replace, debugging, version control. These wealth of options
        make life a lot easier, and they are just not implemented as well or missing completely in Dreamweaver.</p>
    <h2 id='configuring-vscode'>Configuring VSCode</h2>
    <p>The only thing that I miss from Dreamweaver is the DOM panel. It is a very handy tool, but I can live without it
        by just looking at the code itself. The other big selling point of Dreamweaver is the live preview that it
        gives. This preview allows you to quickly see changes and catch errors early. VSCode implements this feature
        through the use of an extension, and does it much better in my opinion. The extension <a
            href='https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer'>Live Server</a> by Ritwick
        Dey creates a local web server that runs on your machine. It opens your website in a browser, and simulates what
        your website would look like in the real world. It updates whenever you save a file, but can be made to update
        almost instantly by enabling auto saving in VSCode. With this extension you can keep VSCode on one side, while
        viewing a real world preview of your website in the browser of your choice. There are also many other extensions
        you can install to extend your editing capabilities even further. You can also enable more superfluous
        extensions to make the editor your own, such as my favorite theme <a
            href='https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme'>One Dark Pro</a> by
        binaryify, or changing the keybindings to match my most used Java IDE, Intellij with <a
            href='https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=k--kato.intellij-idea-keybindings'>Intellij IDEA
            Keybindings</a> by Keisuke Kato. The main point I&#39;m getting at is that VSCode is like a malleable base
        for you to mold to your specific needs and tastes.</p>
    <h2 id='closing-thoughs'>Closing Thoughs</h2>
    <p>The best tool is often the one you have. If you are proficient in Dreamweaver and enjoy the way it works, then
        you have no need to find anything else. But if you find yourself frustrated, VSCode may be a good option for you
        to try.</p>
