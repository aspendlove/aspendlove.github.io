    <p>I have run a small home server for a couple years now. I'd like to go over how it has evolved and how it is setup
        now. This is part 1 of a 2 part post.</p>
    <h2>Raspberry Pi</h2>
    {{< image src="/images/RaspberryPiServer.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi Server" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;">}}
    <p>My Raspberry Pi server, in a repurposed router casing and with a computer fan.</p>
    <p>My server ambitions started out with a raspberry pi 3B+. I had had it for years, and had even used it as my main
        computer for a while at the start of high school. It was outdated when I put it to work as my server, with the
        raspberry pi 4 already out, but I was ambitious to find a use for the small computer and to learn more about
        running a server.</p>
    <p>I had attempted to run Nextcloud on a raspberry pi before, but I always had issues. The guides I followed used a
        base version of Raspbian Lite that they used as a base to install all the software and configurations needed for
        Nextcloud manually. Weary of trying this method again and failing, I searched for another way, and found <a
            href="https://Nextcloudpi.com/">NextcloudPi</a>, a pre-configured operating system already setup with
        Nextcloud and many tools designed to make managing it easier. It gave me the ability to get my server up and
        running easily, while still giving me a taste of the details of server deployment.</p>
    <p>My little raspberry pi server was in use for about 2 years, running NextcloudPi.</p>
    <h2>Nextcloud</h2>
    <p>My main reason for running a server is Nextcloud. It is a all in one dashboard that contains many services in one
        place. My main uses for it are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Notes</li>
        <li>Contacts</li>
        <li>Calendar</li>
        <li>File storage and file sharing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is a very useful all in one solution that has replaced:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Drive</li>
        <li>Google Contacts</li>
        <li>Google Calendar</li>
        <li>Google Keep</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hosting my own data away from the prying eyes of large companies is one of the reasons that I enjoy running my
        own server. I strive for privacy, as it is continuously compromised to large tech companies. I also enjoy the
        technical aspect of learning about server management. I work summers at an IT company, and this hobby project
        has made me better able to service the servers of my clients.</p>
    <h2>Upgrading</h2>
    <p>After a couple years my raspberry pi server was growing quite sluggish. The nextcloud interface became very hard
        to navigate. I decided it was time to upgrade from an old raspberry pi to something newer.</p>
    <p>I didn't want to spend very much money on this venture, as I didn't think I had to in order to make a good server
        for myself. I capped my budget around $200 and got looking. Many people think that servers have to be very
        specialized equipment, and most depictions of a server are large rack mounted behemoths that look nothing like
        the computers we interact with day to day. The reality is, however, that almost any computer can be a server.
        All that is required to make a server is server software, such as nginx, nextcloud, apache2, and Plex, and a
        network connection. What dedicated enterprise servers bring to the table is certain specialized features that
        make them better tailored to be used at scale. They have redundant power supplies, so that if one fails the
        server does not lose power. They have large banks of specialized error correcting ram in order to ensure
        absolute stability. Their storage is also redundant, with large pools of hard drives being managed so that a
        number of drives can completely fail before data is lost. These niceties, along with others such as easy remote
        management, are what make these specialized servers useful.</p>
    <p>For a personal server, however, I don't need any of that. If my server has downtime, the only person that will be
        affected is me. I don't have to worry about a company full of people losing precious work time waiting for
        server issues to resolve (I only have to worry about that in my IT job ðŸ˜…). I don't need data redundancy because
        I can deal with the downtime of having to restore a backup. Because I didn't need the features of a business
        oriented server, I could get creative in what I used. I settled on a mini PC made by Lenovo around 2014. It is a
        small black box containing an old 4th gen Intel i5, 8 gigs of ram, and 256 gb of ssd storage. I bought it second
        hand from a work colleague and it set me back around $200.</p>
    <h2>Next up</h2>
    <p>In my next post I'm going to go through the deployment of my new server, and frustrating process that finally led
        me to it's current working state.</p>
