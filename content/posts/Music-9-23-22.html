    <p>Just an update on some of the music I&#39;ve been listening to in the past couple months</p>

            <p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_liL7rkJS7o1TqlVJfMvVbY6qenmfkfFno'
                    target="_blank">Hippo Campus -
                    LP3</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hot off the heels of their 4 song LP Good Dog Bad Dream, Hippo campus came out with their
                    latest full length EP since Bambi (2018) earlier this year. The LP continues some of the darker
                    tones that have been
                    present in Hippo campus since Bambi, but fleshes them out a little bit. Overall the album feels more
                    lively and upbeat than Good Dog Bad Dream or Bambi, and includes a couple more pop sounding songs
                    like <em>Ride or Die</em>.</li>

                    Bunny -
                    Emotional Creature</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Beach Bunny&#39;s been on a roll lately, and that continues to be the case with the new album
                    &quot;Emotional Creature&quot;. The album is a very upbeat ride through familiar Beach Bunny love
                    song territory with some evolutionary twists sprinkled in. This album is great if you want to just
                    pop something in and listen to it until it&#39;s done.</li>

                    Growing/Dying</a> and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYQR2wh9nas' target="_blank">Close

                    <p>The Backseat Lovers are one of my all time favorite bands. I saw them when they were small at
                        Kilby Court around 2017. I&#39;ve been following them for the past 5 years now and they&#39;re
                        finally releasing a new full length album. They&#39;re debuting the album live on <a
                            href='https://www.thebackseatlovers.com/tour' target="_blank">tour</a>. Sadly all the first
                        party tickets
                        were taken within minutes of the launch this morning, so if you want to see the new album live,
                        you&#39;ll have to pay an arm and a leg for scalped tickets.</p>
                    <p>If you don&#39;t plan on selling a Kidney any time soon, there are two new songs from the new
                        album released in advance; <em>Growing/Dying</em> and <em>Close Your Eyes</em>. Both are
                        emotionally charged rock pieces that bring a new twist on some of their older songs. I&#39;m
                        excited to see where they take this new album after years of anticipation. If you are interested
                        give the songs above a listen and preorder the album <a
