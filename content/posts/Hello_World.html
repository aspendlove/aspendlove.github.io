    <h2>My journey creating this website</h2>
    <p>I created this website with a tool that was new to me, called Hugo. Here is a brief overview of my process.</p>
    <h3>Finding Hugo</h3>
    <p>I found Hugo on <a href="https://alternativeto.net/software/hugo/about/">AlternativeTo</a> as an alternative to
        WordPress. It looked like it would be much more interesting technically, while still being easy to build and
        deploy as you can use community themes instead of writing the entire interface yourself. I had never used a tool
        like WordPress or Hugo, but Hugo seemed like an interesting option and a good place to start. I had also heard
        good things about the tool from a web developer that I follow on YouTube.</p>
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <p>To get started, I first looked through the available community <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">themes</a> and
        found a couple that caught the eye, namely "paper" and "terminal".</p>
    {{< image src="/images/Paper_Theme_Hugo.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;">}}
        <p><a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-paper/">Paper</a>, pictured above, is a very simple theme. It
            is
            clean and looks nice, but ultimately I decided that it lacked personality. It also had some design quirks
            regarding the profile picture that I found hard to edit without digging into the source code, which is not
            recommended as it would break compatibility with future updates to the theme. In general it is best to avoid
            modifying any of the theme files.</p>
        {{< image src="/images/Terminal_Theme_Hugo.png" alt="Hugo Terminal Theme" position="center"
            style="border-radius: 8px;">}}
            <p><a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/#how-to-start">Terminal</a>, on the other
                hand, is
                nothing but personality. It emulates the design of a command line interface, or CLI, by using blocky
                text
                characters and a somewhat sparse design. Unlike other terminal themes, which lean heavily on the actual
                experience of using a terminal, this theme only portrays some of the look while still keeping in mind
                the user
                experience expected of a website. The only thing that I disliked, was the use of a monospace font for
                every part
                of the website. The font pulled the terminal design together, but provided a less than ideal reading
                experience
                for long bodies of text. I decided that it should be a design flare and not the main text for the
                website.</p>
            <h3>Setting up the website with the Terminal theme</h3>
            <p>Using the Hugo <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">quick start guide</a> I was able
                to very
                easily setup my website with the Terminal theme. I had a bit of a hard time following the guide to
                install the
                Hugo package, but luckily it is included by default in the Fedora linux repositories, and I didn't have
                to
                install a separate homebrew package manager or compile from source.</p>
            <p>Running a single command creates a Hugo website in the current working directory, and another two applies
                the
                community theme. After you've created the website, running the command "hugo server" in the root
                directory of
                the website starts a local live server, which automatically builds and updates based on changes you make
                in real
                time. Hugo's blazing fast build speeds are one of it's main accolades.</p>
            <h3>Changing the main body font for the Terminal theme</h3>
            <p>Changing the font turned out to be a quite complex task, with me not knowing exactly what I was doing,
                but with
                some patience I figured it out in the end. In the Terminal theme <a
                    href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/#how-to-safely-edit-the-theme-a-idhow-to-edit-">documentation</a>,
                it gave a simple method to solving the issue of changing the theme without modifying any of it's files;
                creating
                another style.css file with higher specificity than the theme itself, allowing you to modify the CSS of
                the
                theme while only working with a single file separate from the theme. With this, and some time and
                patience, I
                was able to find a good serif font that fit the terminal theme but was still much more legible, add it
                to the
                CSS file, and apply it to the body of the blog posts I write. To do this I write my posts with a mixture
                of
                Markdown and HTML. I first write in Markdown to provide an easy writing experience that exchanges HTML's
                tag
                structure for special characters that create specific attributes such as headings and ordered lists.
                Instead of
                typing &lt;h1&gt;Heading&lt;/h1&gt;, you can just type # Heading. After I write the actual content in
                markdown,
                I can export to html, and add the necessary HTML classes to apply the correct CSS.</p>
            <h3>Deploying the site</h3>
            <p>Unlike services such as WordPress, Hugo does not porovide hosting for the websites it creates. Luckily,
                however,
                free hosting is included by GitHub pages for anyone with a GitHub account. Deploying the website was as
                simple
                as running "hugo -D" to build the website to the public folder in the root directory of the website,
                uploading it to your github pages repo, and applying a hugo github pages action. My website was then
                publicly accessible from <a href="https://aspendlove.github.io">aspendlove.github.io</a></p>
            <h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
            <p>While making this site may have taken longer than a simple WordPress hosted template, I found the
                learning
                process of Hugo very enjoyable. I am one who would rather have complete control over my website's source
                code
                and deployment, rather than relying on a service to provide it for me, but locking me out of the details
                and
                low-level changes. While Hugo does allow you to create your own website, having the ability to use
                themes
                allowed me to make the personal decision to reliquish some control over the interface, in the interest
                of time
                spent on the project. However, it still allowed me to apply custom css and customize the options the
                theme makes
                available, such as changing the preset color themes. Hugo has been a great tool to work with, and I can
                see
                myself using it for future projects.</p>
