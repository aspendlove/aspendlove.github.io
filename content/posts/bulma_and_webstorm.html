    <p>I have recently been working on my Project 4 for Artx 3000, web design, here at the U. As with most projects I
        work on I&#39;ve tried out a little bit of new tech, and I just wanted to talk about my experiences.</p>
    <h2 id='bulmaio'>Bulma.io</h2>
    <p>I wanted to like Bulma.io. It presents itself as a replacement to bootstrap, but made purely out of CSS, and with
        less of a barrier to entry. It claims to be simpler and require no knowledge of JavaScript or even CSS. It also
        touted its responsive elements. I thought this sounded great, so I added one line of CSS and started.</p>
    <p>It did not go well at all. It presented itself as simpler, but in reality it just complicates everything. If you
        don&#39;t do exactly what it wants you to do how it wants you to do it, it falls apart. It leaves no room for
        custom CSS. You can&#39;t even change the colors of the predefined elements without SASS or complex CSS. I spent
        a considerable amount of time trying to get their navbar to work, because I&#39;ve had issues with navbars in
        the past and a predefined template seemed great. I had so many problems, icons not showing up, drop-downs going
        off the right side of the screen, elements completely disappearing when you resize the window. I eventually came
        up with my own solution. I made a container that holds two flexboxes, one for the left and one for the right.
        You can place elements in either the left or the right flexbox, and they will sit on the corresponding side.
        This solution was incredibly simple to implement, even more so than using float like I have with other navbar
        implementations. This navbar finally seems to do exactly what I want it to.</p>
    <h2 id='webstorm'>WebStorm</h2>
    <p>From the makers of the brilliant Intellij, comes WebStorm. I had seen this pitched as a JavaScript IDE, and
        because of that shied away from it while working on previous projects, even though it is built on the same base
        as Intellij, which I use every week for CS2420 and love. Since I wanted to try JavaScript with this assignment,
        I thought I&#39;d give it a try, and I&#39;m glad I did. Even without getting started on the JavaScript,
        WebStorm is amazing for CSS and HTML. Intellisense is better, refactoring is amazing, and everything is
        generally more cohesive than a text editor like VSCode trying to be an IDE (no offense VSCode). It even has the
        built-in preview like Dreamweaver. If it only had Dreamweaver&#39;s design mode and template support, It would
        be the perfect web development platform. I&#39;m excited to see what it can do with JavaScript.</p>
