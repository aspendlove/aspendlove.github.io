    <p>This is part three of my home server post. Read the other parts
        before this post.</p>
    <h1 id='setting-up-services'>Setting up services</h1>
    <p>After I had my operating system picked out and installed, I had to
        set up the actual software I would run on the server. I&#39;ll
        quickly go over some of the process for each service I run.</p>
    <h2 id='nextcloud'>Nextcloud</h2>
    {{<image src="/images/nextcloud.png" alt="Nextcloud promo image" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;">}}
        <p>To make installing Nextcloud easy, I looked for something between a
            dedicated OS like NextcloudPI, and setting it up from scratch with
            nginx, sqlite, and php. I settled on running the <a href='https://github.com/nextcloud-snap/nextcloud-snap'
                target="_blank">Nextcloud
                snap</a>, which only took a couple of commands to get up and
            running. Because it is a snap, it is completely self contained and
            trivial to setup. After initial setup I had to allow it access to
            external drives, setup https, and configure Nextcloud through the
            web interface.</p>
        <h2 id='yacht'>Yacht</h2>
        <p>To install my other services, I turned to a technology I had not used
            before; <a href='https://www.docker.com/' target="_blank">Docker</a>.
            Docker is a
            way to run applications in their own confined environments, making
            setup and running multiple services easier than trying to install
            everything manually where they can interfere with each other.
            Because I had no experience with Docker, I used <a href='https://yacht.sh/' target="_blank">Yacht</a> to
            easily
            manage my
            applications in a nice graphical user interface.</p>
        <h2 id='jellyfin'>Jellyfin</h2>
        {{<image src="/images/jellyfin.png" alt="jellyfin interface" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;">}}
            <p>Jellyfin is a self hosted media streaming platform. It allows you to
                stream your music and movie files anywhere. I find it handy to
                listen to my music library from wherever I happen to be, and watch
                select videos I ripped from DVD&#39;s. It also has some nice
                features, including a watch party option to watch movies with
                friends remotely.</p>
            <p>To set it up I followed the instructions on the website to setup a
                new docker container. I wanted to share media between Jellyfin and
                Nextcloud without needing to create duplicate files in different
                places, so I created shared central folder for my media which I gave
                access to Jellyfin to through Docker volume configuration, and
                Nextcloud through the external media addon. Now I view and manage my
                files in Nextcloud, and stream them through Jellyfin.</p>
            <h2 id='pi-hole'>Pi-Hole</h2>
            {{<image src="/images/Pi-hole_Screenshot.png" alt="Pi-hole dashboard" position="center"
                style="border-radius: 8px;">}}
                <p>Despite the name, <a href='https://pi-hole.net/' target="_blank">Pi-Hole</a>
                    does not
                    have to be run on a Raspberry Pi. Pi-Hole is a DNS server that
                    filters DNS traffic before forwarding it to a public upstream
                    provider. DNS is the service that translates human readable domain
                    names, such as https://google.com, to computer routable IP
                    addresses. When Pi-Hole acts as your DNS server, it can be
                    configured to block certain connections to websites by simply
                    redirecting the domain names to an empty IP address. This allows
                    Pi-Hole to block ads, trackers, and any other website connections
                    that you desire. I also use it to create my own DNS entry locally,
                    allowing me to access my server on my local network and Tailscale
                    network as octo.pi instead of the full IP address.</p>
                <p>Pi-Hole was also just a docker container, but it has some more setup
                    that I&#39;ll talk about shortly.</p>
                <h2 id='cockpit'>Cockpit</h2>
                <p>Cockpit is remote management software built into Fedora Server. It
                    allows you to manage firewall settings, running processes, systemd
                    services, monitor system performance and resources, and even create
                    a remote terminal connection. It is an incredibly useful tool, and
                    comes setup out of the box. You simply need to access it from a web
                    browser.</p>
                <h2 id='flame-dashboard'>Flame Dashboard</h2>
                <p>All of these services, and some more that I did not talk about, each
                    run on their own network port. To access a service running at port
                    678, you would need to type octo.pi:678. It can get hard to remember
                    all these arbitrary numbers as the ports in use start building up.
                    This is where <a href='https://github.com/pawelmalak/flame' target="_blank">Flame
                        Dashboard </a>comes in. Installed via a Docker container, Flame
                    provides a simple dashboard which you can use to link to all the
                    other services that you run. It acts as a singular place to access
                    the entirety of your server, only requiring you to remember one port
                    number (port 80 for http or 443 for https are used by default in
                    browsers, so if you chose either of those ports you won&#39;t have
                    to specify the port at all).</p>
                {{<image src="/images/flame_dashboard.png" alt="Flame Dashboard" position="center"
                    style="border-radius: 8px;">}}
                    <h2 id='tailscale'>Tailscale</h2>
                    <p>All of these services by default are only confined to your local
                        network for security reasons. You don&#39;t want to expose
                        services
                        to the open network if at all avoidable. Doing so can create
                        security risks for even the most secure servers. To avoid
                        allowing
                        public access to all of these services, I found a tool named <a href='https://tailscale.com/'
                            taget="_blank">Tailscale</a>
                        to provide a
                        different solution. Tailscale contains elements of a VPN, but
                        contains differences too. VPN&#39;s have been popularized lately
                        as
                        a privacy tool, but that ability is actually a small part of
                        what a
                        VPN actually is. </p>
                    <p>VPN stands for Virtual Private Network, and does exactly what it
                        says. It allows you to securely connect to a private network
                        without
                        exposing it to the public internet. It works by creating an
                        encrypted tunnel from your device on the internet, to a local
                        network. Anyone on the internet cannot access this secure
                        tunnel. It
                        has many uses, including some privacy uses. By sending your data
                        through a tunnel in this way, you prevent others from viewing
                        your
                        data. The thing that VPN companies leave out, however, is that
                        the
                        end of the tunnel ends at their servers by necessity, so you are
                        essentially entrusting one company with all your data in order
                        to
                        keep any other random person from accessing it. VPN&#39;s only
                        even
                        prevent metadata, (essentially data about your data such as
                        sender,
                        recipient, time, etc.) from being transmitted publicly. As long
                        as
                        you are using a website with https, your traffic is already
                        encrypted as it travels over the internet.</p>
                    <p>That aside, the reason I would want to use a VPN, is to securely
                        access my server at home, without exposing it to the internet.
                        This
                        is a very secure method to do so, and is actually the standard
                        practice used by businesses when employees need remote access to
                        the
                        company&#39;s servers. When I started looking for VPN&#39;s,
                        however
                        I found an interesting new technology called Tailscale.</p>
                    <p>Tailscale is an interesting new take on a VPN. It is a service
                        that
                        uses traditional VPN technologies to create a new way to access
                        remote resources securely. It creates a system of computers, and
                        facilitates direct communication between them. Instead of
                        connecting
                        your computer to a whole central network, you can create
                        connections
                        between multiple computers on different networks, and access
                        them as
                        if they were a part of a single local network. Direct
                        connections
                        provide lower latency connections between devices, and it has
                        many
                        advanced features that make it appealing. First of all, unlike
                        most
                        VPN&#39;s, which need to be publicly exposed to the internet to
                        allow the encrypted tunnels to be established, Tailscale does
                        not;
                        It can interact with devices through firewalls. Tailscale also
                        provides advanced DNS settings for the devices on the network,
                        allowing me to use Pi-Hole running on my server at home, to
                        provide
                        DNS to my phone wherever I go. It also allows any device I
                        connect
                        to my Tailscale network to access my server quickly and
                        securely. It
                        differs from a traditional VPN, however, because not all traffic
                        is
                        routed through some central network. Tailscale only connects
                        devices
                        together when specifically requested, like when you type in the
                        URL
                        to your server at home. This means that all your other
                        connections
                        go through the internet, which does make it less of a technology
                        for
                        complete privacy by routing all of your data through a single
                        point.</p>
                    <p>Tailscale has a generous free plan, and works great connecting my
                        devices to my server wherever I go.</p>
                    <h2 id='closing-thoughts'>Closing Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>It has taken me a long time to get my server to where it is now,
                        and
                        even now I am still continuing to improve it. But as of right
                        now it
                        has been stable for multiple months now, and will be for many to
                        come. It has been very handy for me, allows me to have more
                        control
                        over the services I use, and has been a fun project for me to
                        learn
                        from. If you have the time and desire to learn from a project
                        like
                        this, I&#39;d definitely recommend you pick up a raspberry pi or
                        old
                        computer, and start exploring what you can do running your own
                        server.</p>
