I wasn't sure what to do for this blog post, so here's a tier list of all the Zelda games (that I've played). If you disagree, then you're wrong :stuck_out_tongue:.

## Played

1.   The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild
     -   Breath of the wild is such an amazing game. It completely revolutionizes the Zelda formula by giving you so much freedom in everything you do. You are thrown in an open world, and given little direction allowing you to go wherever you want to go in the moment. There are so many secrets and places to explore that you can spend hours just getting sidetracked as you move through it's massive world. The physics and chemistry system in this game is phenomenal, allowing things such as lighting your arrows with a torch or angering some bees to take care of your enemies for you. Overall this is a must play, and just barely edges out Minish Cap because of how much of my life it's taken up.
2.   The Legend of Zelda Minish cap
     -   Minish Cap was the first Zelda game I ever played, so I'm a bit biased, but it is still an absolutely phenomenal game. The world is so lively and full of places to explore. There are so many strange side quests that you can distract yourself with in between main story points. The gimmick of this game is that you can shrink yourself down and explore things from a new point of view. When you're small cats become giant ferocious beasts, rain becomes a death sentence, and enemies that were pushovers when you're at your full size become entire boss fights. It's a great game from beginning to end with so much charm. Capcom really knocked it out of the park with this one, and I'm sad that we haven't seen a Capcom x Nintendo crossover Zelda game since.
3.   The Legend of Zelda Twilight princess
     -   I don't have much to say about Twilight princess, it's the product of years of refinement on the traditional Zelda formula cemented by Ocarina of Time. The characters are full of life and the story can stir up emotions in a way most other Zelda games can't. If you want a traditional Zelda game with large dungeon labyrinths, then this is the one for you.
4.   The Legend of Zelda A Link between Worlds
     -   A spiritual successor to A Link to the Past, A Link Between Worlds captures the earlier top down Zelda structure incredibly well. It features an interesting story with many callbacks to past games and other Nintendo franchises. The game plays well, the merging into walls mechanic provides new opportunities for puzzles, and the story, while light, contains some great moments.
5.   The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time
     -   The game that started it all for a lot of people, Ocarina of Time was the first time the series made the jump to 3D. It brought with it innovative 3D camera controls, new gameplay structure, and an iconic and timeless story. Ocarina of time set the benchmark for 3D adventure games for years after it's release.
6.   The Legend of Zelda Triforce heroes
     -   I'm not sure why everyone dislikes this game, it's a hilarious and fun game to play with friends.
7.   The Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening
     -   A good game, if not a bit outdated. One of the weirdest Zelda games to date.
