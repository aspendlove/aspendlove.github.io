As I've become interested in learning to use JavaScript with my websites, I've noticed that there is a lot of competition in this space. With many UI frameworks, JavaScript variations, and the like. Just look at this video [here](https://youtu.be/rFP7rUYtOOg). With all of this noise, it can be hard to know what to actually start with.

The advice I've gotten from programming professors is this. Don't learn to code in JavaScript, learn to code. Take whatever you have, even if you just pick at random, and learn it. Find out how things work, and figure out how you can adapt to work with other technologies. In the field of programming you can't get too attached to one technology, because there's always something shinier around the corner. Being as flexible as possible is the only way to keep up with the field as a whole, and allows you to explore new ideas as you expand your repertoire. So as for me, I will just learn plain JavaScript. I don't need anything fancy to distract me. Once I learn how to code in JavaScript, and understand not only how it works but how the fundamental ideas around why it does things, I can move on to other technologies.
